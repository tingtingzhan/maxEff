    abstract = {Trees in a forest interact and therefore have to be considered as a system of dependent random variates from an unknown stochastic process. One such mathematical model which considers the spatial dependence among trees in a forest and their characteristics is a marked point process. The "points" are the tree positions and the "marks" are tree characteristics such as stem diameters or tree species. Statistical methods for marked point processes can give valuable information on the spatial interaction of trees. They are applied in this paper to describe spatial dependence of stem diameters in a spruce forest, of heights of trees in a stand of pine saplings, and of heights, stem diameters, and crown lengths in a mixed birch-pine forest area.
